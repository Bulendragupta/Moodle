* The 'Data modification API' (convert_data) setting can no longer be configured to use files located within the
  current site data directory ($CFG->dataroot), as it exposes the site to security risks.

=== 3.5.2 ===

* Moved the public function unserializesession in auth/shibboleth/logout.php to auth/shibboleth/classes/helper.php and
  made it private. This function should not have been used outside of this file.

* The config.html file was migrated to use the admin settings API.
  The identifier for configuration data stored in config_plugins table was converted from 'auth/shibboleth' to 'auth_shibboleth'.
